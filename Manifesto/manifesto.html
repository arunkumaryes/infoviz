    <h2>My Manifesto</h2>
    <h3>Information Visualization</h3>
<p><em>My understanding</em></p>
<p>Making any raw data readable visually to the viewer, thereby letting them end up with an information takeaway.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple data translation - Should be sensible, maintaining its simplicity</li>
<li>Complex data translation - Main details should be in first level, further details appear on demand</li>
</ul>
<h3>Purpose &amp; Understanding - The Core</h3>
<p>In the process of translation of data to information, certain aspects based on audience and context should be focused and manipulated to make sense to the viewer. Classification and categorization are must in order to establish the order of reading</p>
<h3>Target the audience, but don't exclude the rest</h3>
<p>My idea is to include all possible audience to see the visualization of any domain. The first level should be made understandable for general public who wants to see my visualization based out of their interest. The second on demand level can be made us of the targeted audience, on demand</p>
<h3>Narration is the key</h3>
<p>A flow that particular data needs to be represented in story and/or visuals. Some narrations will have story, some doesn't. A narration need not have a conclusion at all times. Narration would start from a simple opening and build up as the narration goes</p>
